 <p>My hobby is to read books. A book is a great way to learn new and exciting things and the most important thing is that you have fun while reading and learning from one! A book doesn't necessarily need to  be an encyclopedia for you to learn something from it. Let's say, even a comic book can teach you grammar because of the conversations in it Although it doesn't give you as much knowledge as an encyclopedia does, each book has it's own lesson. </p>
